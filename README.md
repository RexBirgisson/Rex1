I scraped basketball reference individual statistics data for all nba players in the last 3 years.  I wanted to be able to predict which nba players would be allstars for the 2019-20 season.  The train data was the last two seasons.  The model was able to predict 2019-20 NBA all stars with 94% accuracy.  The prediction file is located in this repository.
